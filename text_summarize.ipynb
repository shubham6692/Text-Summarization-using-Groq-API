Si il y a un 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana' (programme de logement du Premier Ministre), alors ceux qui vivent dans des bidonvilles et des slums devraient obtenir leurs maisons. Et il ne devrait pas avoir besoin de faire la queue dans les bureaux gouvernementaux pour cela. Le gouvernement devrait rejoindre l'individu. Puisque vous avez assigné cette responsabilité à moi, quatre millions de familles ont obtenu leurs maisons 'pucca'. Cependant, j'ai rencontré des cas où quelqu'un a été laissé hors des avantages gouvernementaux. Par conséquent, j'ai décidé de faire une autre tournée dans le pays pour écouter les expériences des gens avec les programmes gouvernementaux, pour comprendre si ils ont reçu les avantages attendus et pour m'assurer que les programmes atteignent tout le monde comme prévu sans payer de pots-de-vin.\\n\\nVoici la traduction en français :\\nRésumé de l'allocution :\\n\\nLes gens de tous les coins du pays, impliqués dans les activités gouvernementales, politiques et sociales, se dévouent pour rendre la 'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra' (Pèlerinage de la Résolution d'un Inde développée) un succès.

Ce quelqu'un a eu un accident grave, mais après avoir utilisé la carte, il a pu se faire opérer et il est en train de se rétablir bien.\\n\\nLes bureaucrates, qui élaborent de bons programmes, accélèrent le traitement administratif et allouent même des fonds, se sentent satisfaits de savoir que 50 ou 100 personnes qui devaient recevoir les fonds les ont reçus.

Les fonctionnaires se sentent maintenant satisfaits de leur travail, disant : « J'ai élaboré un bon plan, j'ai créé un dossier, et les bénéficiaires ciblés ont reçu les avantages ». Lorsqu'ils entendent des histoires comme celle d'une veuve pauvre qui a reçu un soutien sous le Jeevan Jyoti, ils se sentent satisfaits.\\n\\nIl y a très peu de personnes qui comprennent le pouvoir et l'impact de la 'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra'. Lorsque j'entends les gens qui travaillent dans les cercles bureaucratiques en parler, exprimer leur satisfaction, cela résonne avec moi. J'ai entendu des histoires où quelqu'un a reçu soudainement 2 lakhs de roupies après la mort de son mari, et une sœur a mentionné comment l'arrivée du gaz dans sa maison a transformé sa vie.\\n\\nLe plus important est lorsque quelqu'un dit que la distinction entre la pauvreté et la richesse a disparu. Alors que le slogan 'Garibi Hatao' (Enlevez la pauvreté) est une chose, mais la vraie mutation se produit lorsque quelqu'un dit : « Dès que le gaz a été allumé dans ma maison, la distinction entre la pauvreté et la richesse s'est évanouie. »\""

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

      "\n",
      "It seems there's no provided text for the speech. However, based on the given information, here's a possible summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, considered it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, where they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of India's youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud nation. The President highlights the importance of empowering villages to achieve this goal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The President recalls a visit to Nagaland in 2002, where they observed a village council functioning with financial powers, contributing to the village's prosperity. However, they noted a need for physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President also shares an example of the Periyar PURA initiative, a complex involving 65 villages, providing urban amenities such as healthcare, education, and vocational training. This has led to large-scale employment generation and the creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and providing them with the necessary infrastructure and amenities to enable them to compete and thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights a successful project called Periyar PURA (Provisioning Urban Rural Ambiences), which has been implemented in the Thanjavur district. Key achievements include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 1000 self-help groups have been actively supported to generate employment and create entrepreneurs.\n",
      "2. 200 acres of waste land has been transformed into cultivable land, enabling villagers to grow various crops, including Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants.\n",
      "3. The villagers are also engaged in power generation using biomass, food processing, and marketing.\n",
      "4. The project has developed a sustainable economic model for the region.\n",
      "5. In partnership with Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women and JETRO, the villagers have created internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products.\n",
      "6. This project has enhanced the innovative abilities of the people, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the need for similar projects to bridge the rural-urban divide and suggests that 7000 such PURA projects are required across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, they met over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker mentioned the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve the nation's economic conditions through the 'Seed to Food' principle. They also expressed confidence in the nation's ability to increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the speaker recounts a beautiful experience with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man without hands and legs who was born with his condition. Despite his physical limitations, he was confident and radiant, and he expressed a desire to sing in front of the speaker. He declined the speaker's offer of help, emphasizing that he was content with his life and needed nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech revolves around two main themes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it highlights the story of a person with physical challenges who possesses a hidden talent for music. Despite his limitations, he was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others to pursue his passion for music. He eventually showcased his talent by performing in front of the speaker and later on a larger stage, inspiring others through his art.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message from this story is about the potential of individuals to overcome their challenges and achieve greatness through perseverance and positive attitude. It emphasizes the importance of encouragement and support from others in helping people reach their full potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speech shifts its focus to the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake in Jammu & Kashmir. The speaker shares their experience of visiting Urusa village, where the school had been severely damaged. Despite the devastating losses, the villagers showed remarkable resilience and courage in the face of adversity. They expressed their gratitude towards the Army, Air Force, and state government for their rescue and relief efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes by highlighting the importance of partnership in overcoming the impact of disasters like the earthquake. It emphasizes the need for collective efforts from various stakeholders, including the government, military, and community, to provide relief and support to those affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is recalling two instances of courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first instance is from a recent visit where the speaker witnessed the participation of villagers, including children, in relief operations after an earthquake. They were smiling and interacting with the speaker, and even the local authorities, including the acting Chief Justice, were actively involved in providing relief grants to victims. The speaker highlights the bravery and courage of the citizens in such situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second instance is from 2005, when the speaker visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami. Despite many human losses, the islanders showed remarkable courage by taking in the affected victims as their own children, rather than establishing an orphanage. The speaker was so moved by their example that they composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which was sung by the villagers with great enthusiasm. The poem emphasizes the importance of courage and faith in overcoming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speaker is highlighting the importance of courage, resilience, and community spirit in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a proposed project called the \"Pan African e-Network.\" The project aims to establish a seamless and integrated network connecting 53 African countries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Key components of the project include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Connecting 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa) \n",
      "- Connecting 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa)\n",
      "- Establishing 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "- Establishing 53 tele-education centers\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilot project for tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, and the Indira Gandhi National Open University has begun an MBA course for Ethiopian students.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from Prime Minister of India, but the name is not specified. The summary of the speech is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker mentions a project where Indian doctors provide one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, since 2006. This project aims to bring societal transformation to the African continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then expresses pride in India's Defence Forces, mentioning personal experiences such as visiting the Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and flying a Sukhoi-30 fighter. They emphasize the bravery and commitment of the Defence Forces and para-military forces in keeping the nation safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform youth into enlightened citizens and work towards a developed India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker discusses the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They highlight the Lead India 2020 Foundation, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh. The speaker shares specific examples of the positive impact of the training program, including improved self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. They also mention a student leader who used the 10-point oath from the training to encourage her father to stop smoking. The speaker concludes that empowering India's 540 million youth through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and civilizational heritage while pursuing economic growth. The speaker highlights the need for countrywide participation from multiple institutions to achieve this goal. They express confidence in India's progress, citing its natural resources, hardworking people, particularly the 540 million youth, and the fact that every sector of the country has shown potential to become a developed nation before 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also emphasizes the importance of empowering members of society who are eager to contribute to the nation. They quote a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" to inspire the youth to aim high and achieve their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by outlining five key missions for a developed India 2020:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "2. Providing equitable access to energy and quality water.\n",
      "3. Creating a harmonious balance between agriculture, industry, and the service sector.\n",
      "4. Ensuring that education with a value system is accessible to all meritorious candidates, regardless of societal or economic background.\n",
      "5. Making India the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for an ideal nation by listing 9 key ideals. The summary of these 9 key ideals are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Universal access to quality healthcare.\n",
      "2. Effective, transparent, and corruption-free governance.\n",
      "3. Complete eradication of poverty and illiteracy.\n",
      "4. Zero crimes against women and children.\n",
      "5. A society where everyone feels included and valued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the vision is for a nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, while maintaining sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the 11th President of India. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam expresses his gratitude to the citizens for their support and cooperation over the last five years. He then shares his personal mission: to bridge the gap between the hearts and minds of people in India's multicultural society, instilling confidence that \"we can do it.\" He reaffirms his commitment to working with the citizens to make India a developed nation by 2020.

      "In his departing speech, former Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expressed gratitude to the nation for the opportunity to serve during his five-year tenure. He shared 10 important messages, which included:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development through the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empowering villages.\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Fostering agricultural growth from seed to food.\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through partnership.\n",
      "6. Combating calamities with courage.\n",
      "7. Achieving societal transformation through connectivity.\n",
      "8. Defending the nation with pride.\n",
      "9. Empowering the youth for a Developed India 2020.\n",
      "10. Ensuring that the dreams of the nation's youth, such as Anukriti's, are taken to the highest institution of the nation, inspiring a collective effort to work towards a brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "He appreciated the question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020, and assured her that it was a thoughtful question, reflecting the desire of the youth to live in a developed India. This sentiment is echoed by over 15 lakh youth, whom he met during his tenure, representing the dreams of the 540 million youth of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President emphasized the importance of empowering villages, as seen during his visit to Nagaland in 2002. He witnessed a prosperous village council functioning with financial powers, taking decisions, and producing fruits and vegetables. However, he noted the need for physical connectivity through quality roads for faster movement of products to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also highlighted the successful model of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) initiative, which has been implemented in 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This initiative, supported by the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, provides three connectivities – physical, electronic, and knowledge – leading to economic connectivity. The PURA complex has enabled large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs, with the active support of 1000 self-help groups. The initiative has also developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and the villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, power generation using bio-mass, food processing, and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the President noted that the people of Periyar PURA villages, technologically supported by the Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, worked with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products. This cooperative venture has enhanced the innovative ability of the people and enabled them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President stated that similar PURA models are being established in many states, and that the whole country needs approximately 7000 PURA complexes to bridge the rural-urban divide. He emphasized the importance of seed-to-food initiatives, which are the backbone for agricultural growth.\n",

      "Moreover, President Kalam was inspired by the indomitable spirit of the people and children of Jammu & Kashmir, who were recovering from the devastating earthquake in 2005.

The villagers showed courage and resilience in the face of adversity, working together with the Army, Air Force, and state government to overcome their problems.\n",

      "The President also highlighted the importance of overcoming challenges through partnership, as seen in the example of Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who overcame his physical limitations to pursue his passion for music. The President's experience with Vidwan reminded him of the importance of confidence, training, and help in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",

      "In his departing speech, former Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expressed gratitude to the nation for the opportunity to serve during his five-year tenure. He shared a total of 10 important messages, which included:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development through the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empowering villages.\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Fostering agricultural growth from seed to food.\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through partnership.\n",
      "6. Combating calamities with courage.\n",
      "7. Achieving societal transformation through connectivity.\n",
      "8. Defending the nation with pride.\n",
      "9. Empowering the youth for a Developed India 2020.\n",
      "10. Ensuring that the dreams of the nation's youth, such as Anukriti's, are taken to the highest institution of the nation, inspiring a collective effort to work towards a brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "He appreciated the question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020, and assured her that it was a thoughtful question, reflecting the desire of the youth to live in a developed India. This sentiment is echoed by over 15 lakh youth, whom he met during his tenure, representing the dreams of the 540 million youth of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President emphasized the importance of empowering villages, as seen during his visit to Nagaland in 2002. He witnessed a prosperous village council functioning with financial powers, taking decisions, and producing fruits and vegetables. However, he noted the need for physical connectivity through quality roads for faster movement of products to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also highlighted the successful model of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) initiative, which has been implemented in 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This initiative, supported by the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, provides three connectivities – physical, electronic, and knowledge – leading to economic connectivity. The PURA complex has enabled large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs, with the active support of 1000 self-help groups. The initiative has also developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and the villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, power generation using bio-mass, food processing, and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the President noted that the people of Periyar PURA villages, technologically supported by the Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, worked with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products. This cooperative venture has enhanced the innovative ability of the people and enabled them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President stated that similar PURA models are being established in many states, and that the whole country needs approximately 7000 PURA complexes to bridge the rural-urban divide. He emphasized the importance of seed-to-food initiatives, which are the backbone for agricultural growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his tenure, President Kalam met with thousands of farmers and scientists, and was inspired by their passion and commitment to increasing agricultural production. He noted that the nation has the potential to double its agricultural production with reduced land, water resources, and manpower, and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \"Seed to Food\". He emphasized the importance of empowering farmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for a second green revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President also shared his experiences of meeting people from various parts of the country who exemplified courage and resilience in the face of adversity. He visited Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, which had been adopted by the Western Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents. The villagers showed courage and resilience in the face of adversity, working together with the Army, Air Force, and state government to overcome their problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Car Nicobar Islands, he witnessed the unique trait of the Car-Nicobar islanders, who took possession of affected victims as their children and showed no need for an orphanage. This act of courage inspired the President to compose a poem called \"Sea Waves\". The islanders also sang the poem with him, exhibiting lots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe suffering during the Tsunami.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President also addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South Africa, where he emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation. He proposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an estimated cost of US $ 100 million. This project aimed to connect 12 universities, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. The pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned, with Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President's message was one of hope and optimism for India's future, emphasizing the importance of empowering villages, promoting agricultural growth, and harnessing the potential of the nation's youth. He encouraged the nation to work together towards a brighter future, inspired by the success stories of the Periyar PURA initiative and the indomitable spirit of the people he met during his tenure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, President Kalam highlighted the importance of defending the nation, and expressed his pride in the Indian Armed Forces, who are committed to protecting the nation's integrity. He mentioned his experiences of interacting with the Indian Armed Forces, including a visit to the Siachen Glacier, an underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak, and a flight in a Sukhoi-30 fighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President also emphasized the need to empower the youth, and mentioned his interactions with the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is working towards transforming the youth into enlightened citizens. He also mentioned the establishment of a one-hour live tele-consultation service for doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, using the Pan African network.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President's message concluded with a heartwarming experience of singing with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who had been inspired by the President's visit and had gone on to perform in the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in July 2007. This experience illustrated the power of positive attitude, perseverance, and support in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",

      "In his departing speech, former Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expressed gratitude to the nation for the opportunity to serve during his five-year tenure. He shared a total of 10 important messages, which included:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development through the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empowering villages.\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Fostering agricultural growth from seed to food.\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through partnership.\n",
      "6. Combating calamities with courage.\n",
      "7. Achieving societal transformation through connectivity.\n",
      "8. Defending the nation with pride.\n",
      "9. Empowering the youth for a Developed India 2020.\n",
      "10. Ensuring that the dreams of the nation's youth, such as Anukriti's, are taken to the highest institution of the nation, inspiring a collective effort to work towards a brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "He appreciated the question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020, and assured her that it was a thoughtful question, reflecting the desire of the youth to live in a developed India. This sentiment is echoed by over 15 lakh youth, whom he met during his tenure, representing the dreams of the 540 million youth of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President emphasized the importance of empowering villages, as seen during his visit to Nagaland in 2002. He witnessed a prosperous village council functioning with financial powers, taking decisions, and producing fruits and vegetables. However, he noted the need for physical connectivity through quality roads for faster movement of products to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also highlighted the successful model of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) initiative, which has been implemented in 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This initiative, supported by the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, provides three connectivities – physical, electronic, and knowledge – leading to economic connectivity. The PURA complex has enabled large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs, with the active support of 1000 self-help groups. The initiative has also developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and the villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, power generation using bio-mass, food processing, and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the President noted that the people of Periyar PURA villages, technologically supported by the Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, worked with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products. This cooperative venture has enhanced the innovative ability of the people and enabled them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President stated that similar PURA models are being established in many states, and that the whole country needs approximately 7000 PURA complexes to bridge the rural-urban divide. He emphasized the importance of seed-to-food initiatives, which are the backbone for agricultural growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his tenure, President Kalam met with thousands of farmers and scientists, and was inspired by their passion and commitment to increasing agricultural production. He noted that the nation has the potential to double its agricultural production with reduced land, water resources, and manpower, and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \"Seed to Food\". He emphasized the importance of empowering farmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for a second green revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President also shared his experiences of meeting people from various parts of the country who exemplified courage and resilience in the face of adversity. He visited Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, which had been adopted by the Western Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents. The villagers showed courage and resilience in the face of adversity, working together with the Army, Air Force, and state government to overcome their problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Car Nicobar Islands, he witnessed the unique trait of the Car-Nicobar islanders, who took possession of affected victims as their children and showed no need for an orphanage. This act of courage inspired the President to compose a poem called \"Sea Waves\". The islanders also sang the poem with him, exhibiting lots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe suffering during the Tsunami.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President also addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South Africa, where he emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation. He proposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an estimated cost of US $ 100 million. This project aimed to connect 12 universities, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. The pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned, with Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President's message was one of hope and optimism for India's future, emphasizing the importance of empowering villages, promoting agricultural growth, and harnessing the potential of the nation's youth. He encouraged the nation to work together towards a brighter future, inspired by the success stories of the Periyar PURA initiative and the indomitable spirit of the people he met during his tenure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, President Kalam highlighted the importance of defending the nation, and expressed his pride in the Indian Armed Forces, who are committed to protecting the nation's integrity. He mentioned his experiences of interacting with the Indian Armed Forces, including a visit to the Siachen Glacier, an underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak, and a flight in a Sukhoi-30 fighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President also emphasized the need to empower the youth, and mentioned his interactions with the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is working towards transforming the youth into enlightened citizens. He shared the example of the Lead India 2020 Foundation's training program in Medak district, Andhra Pradesh, which has shown a positive impact on the students, making them more disciplined, responsible, and patriotic. He also mentioned the story of Ms. Padma, a student leader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda, who inspired him with her dedication to her community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President concluded by stating that with the ignited minds of the 540 million youth below the age of 25, which he considers the most powerful resource on the earth, we have to empower the youth through value-based education and leadership. He envisioned a Developed India 2020 with a distinctive profile, which includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line.\n",
      "2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and quality water.\n",
      "3. A Nation where agriculture, industry, and service sector work together in symphony.\n",
      "4. A Nation where education with a value system is not denied to any meritorious candidates because of societal or economic discrimination.\n",
      "5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "6. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all.\n",
      "7. A Nation where governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free.\n",
      "8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed, and crimes against women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated.\n",
      "9. A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy and continues with a sustainable growth path.\n",
      "\n",
      "He emphasized that it is the duty of the nation to preserve its rich and diverse treasures of culture and civilization for future generations, and that every sector of the country has shown considerable progress in the last sixty years, with the power of the 540 million youth being the driving force. He encouraged the nation to work together to achieve this vision, inspired by the success stories of the Periyar PURA initiative and the indomitable spirit of the people he met during his tenure.\n",
      "\n",
